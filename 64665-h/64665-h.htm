<h1>AN EXCITING NEW YEAR’S DAY IN JUNGLETOWN</h1>

<div class="chapter">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The first of January dawned bright and clear, much to
the gratification of the inhabitants of Jungletown, for
King Leo had decreed that various sporting contests
should take place on Monkey Hill. There were to be foot races
on skis and snow shoes, snow ball encounters and toboggan
races. In fact, almost every kind of winter sport was
to be indulged in, with the exception of skating, for the
king was averse to that amusement, and never included it
in his entertainments.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">All the animals, from the very big bear down to
the little squirrel, ever since the day for the sports had
been set, had looked forward to it, with eager anticipation
and joy, and had worked busily, getting things in readiness,
for much was accomplished before the eventful day arrived.</p>

<p>First, there had to be a space cleared for the spectators, with
a special tract set aside for the king and his friends; then the
making of a fine slide for the tobogganers, and the marking of
the bounds for the foot races. Moreover, each family
provided a full lunch basket, so the mothers and daughters
were also busy planning what they should cook.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-f.jpg" width="100" height="90" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Finally, when the day came, all was ready. Most families
had even packed the food the day before. So it
happened that quite early in the morning a large crowd
had gathered on Monkey Hill. Not only all the citizens of Jungletown,
itself, and their families were there, but also
animals, whose homes were many miles away, had
come to see the fun.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Thus, when one o’clock, the hour set for the races to
commence, came, the hill was simply alive with elephants,
giraffes, bears, wolves, foxes, monkeys, ’possums,
coons, squirrels, and many other animals, besides the relatives
of the king, lions, tigers and leopards.</p>

<p>Then the jolly, good time began, and what a glorious afternoon
they all had. The ski race, between the bears and the
squirrels, came first, and was very exciting, for, although the
squirrels were much smaller than the bears, they were so much
lighter on their feet, and could manage their skis better, that
they won the race.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Next came the equally animated snow shoe race, between
the elephants and giraffes, the latter winning in the end.
After the foot races were finished, there were snow
fights between different parties, and then the time came for the
toboggan races to begin. They
aroused even more excitement
than any of the previous contests,
but were also the cause
of a serious accident.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a.jpg" width="100" height="75" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">All went well, until the last load of tobogganers, composed
of monkeys, ’possums and squirrels, had started
down the hill. Suddenly, as the toboggan was skimming
along the slide, at a rapid rate of speed, a screech was
heard from behind, and Jack ’Possum looked around to see a poor
squirrel lying on the ground, several yards back, seemingly senseless.
The little fellow had been at the end, and when the toboggan
gave a slight lurch, as it passed over an uneven place in the
slide, he lost his balance and fell backward.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">As soon as the accident had been discovered the race was
stopped, and a crowd gathered about him. For a time,
some thought him dead. However, when Sir Thomas
Lion, a cousin of the king, and a very prominent physician in
Jungletown, reached his side, he found one leg broken, but
said the squirrel was not otherwise injured, except temporarily
stunned by the fall. Dr. Lion ordered him carried to
the nearest house, which happened to be that of two nice,
old maid bears. There the doctor set his leg, and soon
afterward he regained consciousness.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Next a search was made for his father and mother, but
none of the squirrels present at the races claimed any
relationship to him. In the course of a few days he told
the two old bears that he was an orphan, and had come many
miles to see the sporting contests.</p>

<p>Now these bears were very kind hearted, and they felt very
sorry for the little homeless creature, and soon became very fond
of him, and he of them. So, when the day came that he was able
to go, they, all three, went to the Jungletown Court, and the
bears legally adopted him.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">From that time on, Tommy Squirrel always had a very
comfortable home and two, dear friends, in these old
maid bears. While they never ceased to be grateful that
the toboggan accident, the day of the sporting contests, had been
the means of their finding a very obedient and loving little charge.</p>
